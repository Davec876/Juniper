# What is Juniper?

Juniper is a Discord mental health bot that checks on your mental health for being a student at Dalhousie Unviersity at least once a day. 

## Inspiration

The idea for Juniper came about one day when we noticed that mental health is very important especially in today's society where mental health is very important and everything being online for the most part such as work and school. It takes a toll one everyone because no one really has an 'escape' these days due to the on-going pandemic and the adjustment to transitioning from in person work and social life to online. 

## Features

**General:** '*help' allows the user to see a general poll of how they're currently feeling.

**Message Screening:** Scans the respective channels for commands that Juniper can detect and responds with a choice of responses from a list.

**Encouragement:** Gives meaningful advice on how to improve their current work flow.


## What's next?

Juniper is an on-going project for the 'CS Dal' Discord server and worked on whenever we have time. We want to add more functionality over time such as new commands and allow for individuals to know that their mental health matters as much as their physical health. Ultimately, we want to make Juniper as good as she can be with all appropriate functionalities in due time.
